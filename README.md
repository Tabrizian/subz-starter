### Routes
In the ```routes``` directory you can specify the required routes for your application. There is currently two main route
groups:

The ```common.js``` contains routes related to general application pages such as the index page. The ```movies.js``` contains
the routes specific for movies. For example we have included two routes in here to help you get started.
